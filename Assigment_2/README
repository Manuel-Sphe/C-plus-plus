README FOR COMPILATION, CLEANING FILES AND RUNNING OF THE APPLICATION

COMPILATION use command: $make               #so we use Makefile, all excutable file will be on the current directory (Assignment_2)

RUNNING use command:
option1 - Test core work:
./extractor image_name -t x1 y1 x2 y2 -s width height -w process outputfilename  # for E.G ./extractor larger_image.pgm -t 0 0 800 800 -s 600 600 -w none SIMPLE 
                                                                                 # process can be none or reverse or invert or revinvert 
                                                                                 #outputfilename will be concatenated with image number like filename-NNNN.pgm, where NNNN is the number
 option2 - Test core work:
./extractor image_name -t x1 y1 x2 y2 -s width height -w process outputfilename process outputfilename #for E.G  ./extractor larger_image.pgm -t 0 0 800 800 -s 600 600 -w none simple1  invert  simple2

option3 - Test mastery , Path:
./extractor image_name -p n x1 y1 x2 y2 x3 y3 -s width height -w process outputfi # For E.G ./extractor image_name -p 3 0 0 800 800 0 0 -s 100 100 -w none 3POINT
                                                                                # here we tell video which path to use instead of start -End
                                                                                # -t is replaced by -p 
                                                                                # n is the number of path to take, in our example above n=3
                                                                                # Other part of command is the same as above
option3 - Test mastery, Acceleration of video
./extractor image_name -t x1 y1 x2 y2 -s width height -w process outputfilename -a maximumAcceleration #eg ./extractor image_name -t 0 0 100 100 -s 100 100 -w none ACCELERATE_SIMPLE -a 100
                                                                                                       # so maxmum acceleration = 100
                                                                                                      # all other part of the command are same as above
                                                                                                      # just added to command to allow user to enter acceleration it wants
                                                                                                      # Added -a which indicate user has given maximum acceleration
                                                                                                      # maximumAcceleration- is the maximum acceleration use wants vidoe to accelerate upto the de-accelerate
                                                                                                      #If user does not give acceleration, then its defaulted to zero on the code the application
                                                                                                      # So acceleration can be included at options or others by just adding -a maxAcceleration after outputfilename

CLEANING use command: $make clean  # all *.pgm, *.png, *.mp4, *.o ,extractor will be removed
